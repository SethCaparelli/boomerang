# Boomerang Project Proposal

## The Problem
For everybody, life is very busy and we are often not able to attend or celebrate with the our friends. There are times when loved ones are gathered at a bar celebrating a birthday or an accomplishment, and we are stuck out of town on business. We have become increasingly farther away from people in distance but so close socially. In a lot of ways, we are able to connect with people from across the world. With a couple clicks of an iPhone we can video chat with someone in another state, but wouldn't be nice to buy your best friend a drink from across the world?

## The Solution
Boomerang uses the GPS technology to notify users of when their friends are at participating bar or restaurant. Users are able to buy a drink for the person at the bar anonymously or not. The friend at the bar receives a message attached to QR code redeemable for a menu item from the restaurants menu. The beautiful thing about this app is that you do not have to let people know you are even going out. Boomerang discreetly notifies your friends you are at the restaurant, and they can buy you a drink as if they were there themselves.

## User Experience
The user experience for this application is broken up into two stories. One user story would be that of the recipient. That user would simply receive notifications, called boomerangs, from the app stating a friend had purchased a drink or menu item for them. All that the user would have to do is open the notification, read the message, and have someone from the restaurant scan the QR code to order the item. If the user does not choose to use the QR code for any reason, it will be stored for a limited time. The next time they are at the restaurant the app will notify the user of the unused voucher. If redeemed, the user can enjoy the cocktail or appetizer and send a thank you message if desired.

The other user story of Boomerang is that of the giver. This user is notified by the app that a friend is at or near a participating bar or restaurant. The user can then enter the app and look through the menu items for an item to purchase their friend. They may also just choose to send a dollar amount to be redeemed rather than a specific menu item. They may customize the voucher with any message or picture of their choosing. The next step is for them to go out and celebrate, and hopefully a friends send them a boomerang.

At any time, Users my enter the app and see if their friends are out celebrating and do not have to rely on notifications. Users may also see other non-friend users that are at the same bar or restaurant. This gives users the opportunity to connect and make more friends.

## Technologies
I want to highlight some UX/UI design processes, so for my new technology I want to use Axure. Axure is a prototyping technology used by the industries UX designers.

For the Front-End, I plan to use React Native and perhaps bootstrap, which would also be a new technology. I am also planning on using Socket.io for the chat aspect of the application, and possibly Docker or Kubernetes for deployment (also new tech).

For the back-end, Node.js will be the main player along with MongoDB for the database and express for the server.
